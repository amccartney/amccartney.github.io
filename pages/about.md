Hi, I'm Allison. I'm a visual journalist, designer, coder and semi-lapsed printmaker. I design the web, make apps, draw illustrations and write articles.  

During the day, I split my time between working at the [Brown Institute for Media Innovation](http://brown.stanford.edu) at Stanford and on various data and graphics freelance projects. Nights, I'm either teaching at [UC Berkeley](https://journalism.berkeley.edu/curriculum/newmedia/), figure drawing or touring San Francisco's Mission District taquerias.

Before coming to the Bay Area, I was the editor of [PBS NewsHour Extra](http://www.newshour.pbs.org/extra), the [PBS NewsHour's](http://newshour.pbs.org) educational resources site in Arlington, Virginia. I wrote, edited and produced Extra’s content, and created multimedia assets for the NewsHour’s main online operation.

I have a master's degree in journalism from Stanford and an bachelor's degree in Jewish, Islamic and Near Eastern studies from Washington University in St. Louis.

If you'd like to know more about me, check out my [resume](/resume/).
