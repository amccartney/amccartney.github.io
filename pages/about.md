Hi, I'm Allison. I'm a visual journalist, designer, coder and semi-lapsed printmaker. I design the web, make apps, draw illustrations and write articles.  

During the day, I split my time between a Magic Grant project with the [Brown Institute for Media Innovation](http://brown.stanford.edu) and working as the Data Fellow at the [Center for Investigative Reporting](http://www.revealnews.org). Nights, I'm either teaching at [UC Berkeley](link to new media site), crushing bar trivia or "exploring" San Francisco's Mission District taquerias.

Before coming to the Bay Area, I was the editor of [PBS NewsHour Extra](http://www.newshour.pbs.org/extra), the [PBS NewsHour's](http://newshour.pbs.org) educational resources site in Arlington, Virginia. I wrote, edited and produced Extra’s content, and created multimedia assets for the NewsHour’s main online operation.

I have a master's degree in journalism from Stanford and an bachelor's degree in Jewish, Islamic and Near Eastern studies from Washington University in St. Louis.

If you'd like to know more about me, check out my [resume](/resume/).
