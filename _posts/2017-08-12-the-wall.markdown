I designed and developed the application for [The Wall](http://revealnews.org/border-wall) using Mapbox GL and Node to generate the map and graphics. This map built on the data collected by the Reveal data team, which is the first open-sourced data set of the current infrastructure separating the US and Mexico. It was used to accompany Reveal’s look into the costs and repercussions of Donald Trump’s proposed border wall.
