In the lead-up to Newsgeist, Google News held a yet another journalism conference at the Googleplex in Mountain View where, inevitably, "fake news" came under the microscope. Despite the fact that there are several kinds of "fake news" that seem to all get lumped under same umbrella, the discussion seems to have become binary. I say this because I wasn't at this other journalism conference, having officially conferenced-out at Mozfest.

The simple and binary solution, as determined by Google, a "content" distributor, is to create a label that alerts readers to "legitimate" or "fake" news sources--a sort of badge to encourages the audience to read with caution, or avoid certain outlets all together.

They are not alone in this line of thinking. In the wake of the election, where conspiracy theories--regardless of how much they swayed actual election results--became a feature of nation-wide conversation. No longer relegated to corners of the internet, ideas that otherwise would be considered to outlandish to print due to lack of reportable evidence are earning their places on front pages due to the fact that enough people believe them to make them actionable.

I want to argue that the loss of local newspapers across the country has created the conditions for misinformation and conspiracies to thrive in a number of ways, and that restoring the trust between journalists and the public doesn't lie in a changing an algorithm on Facebook or requiring a verified badge on Google news sources, but rather in a reinvestment in local media projects that provide contact points between the press and those most swayed by fake news.

The election prompted a lot of soul-searching among journalists who feel like they got it wrong. Polls, debate performance, campaign spending and even action from the candidates themselves seemed to speak to the results of the election long before the first exit poll results rolled in, and most journalists called it as they saw it.

Journalists have renewed calls to spend more time in the interior of the country, trying to understand Trump's base, and diagnose how someone like him could win. This is the wrong approach. Journalists shouldn't have to try to understand these populations because they should represent them and be their information curators. People in the interior of the country don't trust news because news isn't created anywhere near them, geographically, by people they see as other.

In the past, hometown newspapers offer a local perspective on local and national events, putting them into that local context. They were generally staffed by people who lived in those towns, not by "parachute" journalists who drop in for a few days, weeks, months at a time. These local newspaper writers held sway in their communities because they *were* their communities. You might run into them at a store, or find one of them as your neighbor. The terrifying thing about being a local reporter is that if you get something wrong, there's no way to avoid the resulting confrontation.

But this also keeps local reporters accountable to their communities, and that accountability garners trust.

With the loss of the local nature of news, people around the country no longer know journalists, no longer see them at work or can look them in the eyes when they do something wrong. Like any type of person who you never encounter, these disembodied journalists who post things on the internet from places like New York and San Francisco are easy to misunderstand and caricature. 

*Find some stats on journalism trust by geography*

Much has been made about the urban-rural divide in politics, but an overlooked aspect of this schism is that there are still local newspapers  People near where

*Oooh ooh ooh -- lets do a study where we find correlation between the closing of local papers and the percentage of that county that went to Trump. That's fucking awesome*

The idea of putting a "fake news" warning on certain publications does not solve this problem, by most likely exacerbates it. Google, Facebook, or other massive online content distributors become just a few more coastal, out-of-touch sources for information imperialism. It risks widening the media consumption schism that has already opened up, and could create fewer shared online spaces for traditional outlets to draw readers back.

Instead, we need to find a way to bolster

During the campaign, journalists found their judgement calls coming into conflict with traditional rules of impartiality. How our system is set up to cover candidates outside the mainstream is for some other blog post to cover, but journalists must find a way to exibit their professional alarm at the actions of a candidate they truly see as a threat to democratic system without falling prey to allegations of bias. By mistaking professional judgement for bias, audiences pit themselves against the journalists, publications and outlets that disagree with them. Audiences see allegations of "fake" as just a new way for elites to alienate, delegitimize and disregard their concerns.

Difference in practice, methodology, principle and intent separate career journalists from other types of media, but that difference is often not understood by the audience.
