I was responsible for redesigning and implementing the front end of [Represent](http://projects.propublica.org/represent), ProPublica's Congress-tracking app. I oversaw the transition from Represent's previous structure to a new ProPublica grid system, replacing nine years' worth of styles. I'm currently redesigning the homepage and inner pages one-by-one while implementing entirely new pages to add insight to user's understading of Congress and their representatives.
